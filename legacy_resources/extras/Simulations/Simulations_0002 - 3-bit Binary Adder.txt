                             | 3-BIT BINARY ADDER |
                             +====================+

Adds two 3-bit binary numbers together.

There is an LPB included as an example. It shows 101 (5) being added to 100 (4)
to produce 1001 (9).

The numbers are selected within the game so no editing is required.

The path you take is always the same and you are not required to shoot anything
(other than for choosing the numbers you wish to add together).

The numbers that are available to choose range from 000 (0) to 111 (7). The
maximum result is therefore 1110 (14).


Instructions
============

1. Choose the two numbers you wish to add by pushing the appropriate blocks at
   Row 15 onto the tunnels at Row 16.

      1st number: F15-J15, 2nd number: L15-P15

      The digit "1" is represented by a block being pushed onto a tunnel at that
      position, "0" by doing nothing; eg if you wish to add 101 and 011 then
      push the blocks in columns F, J, N, and P down

      Note: your entry is rectified for computation (just like a real
      calculator!) but the result will display correctly

2. Move onto the RED tunnel at P14.

3. Move LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN, then RIGHT onto the GREEN tunnel at E3.

4. Move RIGHT, DOWN, UP, UP.

5. Move RIGHT, RIGHT, DOWN, RIGHT back to where you started.

6. The result is displayed in the ice-bordered mantissa at M8-P8.

7. To perform another addition, RESTART the level.
