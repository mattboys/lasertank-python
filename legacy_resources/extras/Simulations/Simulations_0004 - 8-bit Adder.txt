                                | 8-BIT ADDER |
                                +=============+

Adds two 8-bit binary numbers together.

There is an LPB included as an example. It shows 11001101 (205) being added to
10101100 (172) to produce 101111001 (377).

Unfortunately there was not enough room to permit easy selection of numbers
within the game (and the disposal of excess blocks) so the numbers must be
entered via an editor.

However, the path you take is continuous - no stopping and starting, no
decisions to make.

This level also does not rectify or rearrange bits during entry so you can
clearly see the two numbers you have entered although unique bits do get pushed
into water as part of the computation process. (You can't have everything :-)

The numbers that are available to choose range from 00000000 (0) to 11111111
(255). The maximum result is therefore 111111110 (510).

Not perfect - needs a little tweaking.


Instructions
============

1. Using the built-in editor, enter the two numbers you wish to add at E-M7 and
   E-M8.

      The digit "1" is represented by a block being present at the corresponding 
      position, "0" by ICE. The ice is important and it is critical for there to 
      be an ice tile in Row 8 if there is a block above it in Row 7. It doesn't
      matter for other permutations but it is simpler and neater to just ensure
      that there are no ground tiles in E-M7 or E-M8. 101001100 would require
      you to place blocks at E7, G7, I7, and J7 if it was the first number or
      the same columns in Row 8 if the second (as in the example included with
      the level).

2. When you've entered your two numbers, exit the editor and SAVE the level.
   (You might wish to save a backup of the original first).
      
3. Jump on the mover and enjoy the ride.

4. When you are eventually blocked on the mover, you will be able to read the
   result in Row 14, with a block at D14 for the 9th bit overflow if required.

5. To perform another addition, RESTART the level.
