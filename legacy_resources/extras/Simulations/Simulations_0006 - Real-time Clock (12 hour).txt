                         | REAL-TIME CLOCK (12 HOUR) |
                         +===========================+

Marks out time (in 4 second increments) up to 12 hours when it resets to
00:00:00 and starts again.

Finally, a non-frivolous use for Mr Ledpeddle's counters ;-)

Instructions
============

1. Just get on the mover. Do this when you wish to start timing because the
   timer is already at 00:00:00.

2. Each complete lap takes you 8 seconds but each AT is triggered once during
   that lap (for two evenly spaced shots) so the rotations of the mirrors occur
   every 4 seconds.

3. Every 5 half-laps (=20 seconds) a shot makes it through the first counter
   (K11-N12) to the next. Crystal blocks make it easier to see when this
   occurs as they light up.

4. Every third shot that makes it through the first counter also makes it
   through the second, thus indicating that a minute has passed (3 x 20 sec).

5. Similarly, every fifth shot entering the third counter gets through, and
   every sixth shot entering the fourth counter makes it through to shoot the
   pink block along 1 space. This occurs every 5x3x5x6 shots which is
   4x5x3x5x6 = 1,800 seconds = half an hour.

6. After 24 movements of the block (12 hours) everything is back to its
   starting configuration.
   
7. It is hard to read the time from the configuration of the various mirrors so
   it is even less useful than the 1 hour timer. It's just a proof of concept.

8. There is, of course, a slight delay with the movement of the pink blocks
   since the shot needs some time to work it's way through the various counters.

9. Again, accuracy may be affected by other processes running on your computer.
