                          | REAL-TIME CLOCK (1 HOUR) |
                          +==========================+

Marks out time (in 6 second increments) up to 1 hour when it resets to 0:00:00
and starts again.

Instructions
============

1. Just get on the mover. Do this 1 second before you wish to start timing
   because that is how long it takes you to trigger the first AT.

2. Your first lap resets the timer to 0:00:00 and thence after triggers the AT
   at P1 to shoot the AT on the red tunnel down 1 space each time you pass.

3. Each lap takes you 6 seconds so each increment of the red-tunnel AT
   represents 6 sec of time which is why there are 10 positions for it
   (= 1 minute).

4. At the end of 1 minute the red-tunnel AT is pushed into the purple tunnel
   and triggered to shoot the green-tunnel AT down 1 (and then reset back to
   display 6 sec increments again). This, therefore, represents the minutes.

   Space considerations demanded that the 60 minutes of an hour be shown as
   3x4x5 although I changed this to 4x3x5 to allow easy reading of 15 minute
   intervals. Thus, after 5 minutes, the green-tunnel AT is reset back to 0.

5. But not before it is pushed into the yellow tunnel and triggered to shoot
   the blue-tunnel AT, etc, etc. The blue-tunnel AT shows whether to add 0, 5,
   or 10 minutes to the time.

6. The black-tunnel AT marks out 15 minute increments.
   
7. The pink blocks indicate the even values for each marker; ie "0" and "30
   minutes" for the black tunnel, and 0, 6, 12, 18, 24, etc minutes for the
   red tunnel.

8. So, with ATs at the following positions - B11, H9, N12, P12, the timer would
   read (2 x 15 = 30) min + (0 x 5 = 0) min + (4 x 1 = 4) min + (7 x 6 = 42) sec 
   or 0:34:42.

9. There is, of course, a slight delay with the movement of successive markers
   but the movement of the red-tunnel AT is quite accurate.

10. This accuracy may be affected by other processes running on your computer.
