                         | 7-BIT ADDER WITH R/W HEADS |
                         +============================+

Adds two 7-bit binary numbers together.

There is an LPB included as an example. It shows 1110101 (117) being added to
1000101 (69) to produce 10111010 (186).

The numbers are selected within the game so no editing is required although
it's a bit messy because you have to dispose of the unwanted blocks.

The path you take is continuous - no stopping and starting, no decisions to
make.

The numbers that are available to choose range from 0000000 (0) to 1111111
(127). The maximum result is therefore 11111110 (254).

Not perfect - needs a little tweaking.


Instructions
============

1. Choose the two numbers you wish to add by pushing blocks onto the tunnels in
   Row 3.

      The digit "1" is represented by a block being pushed onto a tunnel at the
      corresponding position, "0" by doing nothing; eg 1001100 would require you
      to push blocks onto the white, cyan, and blue tunnels.

      1's (blocks) destined for K14/K16 (red tunnel - least significant bit)
      must be first pushed onto J14 and then from K3 to L3 since direct access
      to L3 is blocked.

      The first number to be added shows in E14-K14, the second number shows in
      E16-K16. Some rearrangement of bits occurs to make computation simpler -
      the first occurrence of a "1" at a particular position will appear in
      Row 14 even if it's in the second number; ie 10011 + 10110 will show as
      10111 + 10100. The result will be the same.

2. There MUST be blocks at E3 and F4-K4 when the calculation is started. If you
   move or use the blocks that start in these positions you must replace them
   for the machine to work.

3. Blocks that are not required (for the numbers to be added or for the starting
   blocks) must be disposed of. The safest places to put them so they won't
   interfere with the workings is in the water spaces. The blocks can be doubled
   up (one on top of a "bridge") if desired.

4. Get on a mover anywhere between Rows 5 and 9 and enjoy the ride.

5. When you are eventually blocked on the mover, you will be able to read the
   result in Row 3, with a block at E3 for the 8th bit overflow if required.

5. To perform another addition, RESTART the level.
