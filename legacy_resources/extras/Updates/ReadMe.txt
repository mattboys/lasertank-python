 =======================================
 Here's the LaserTank "All Updates" file
 =======================================

    Take a look at the xxxxxx_Report.html files in this archive for information
 about the changes that were implemented in each levels collection.  NOTE! These
 changes are incremental; i.e., they are relative to the last time that this
 "All Updates" file was posted.

    CAUTION! Any .lvl and .ghs files with later "Modified" dates then their
 corresponding .html file, have new changes that are not listed in this .html
 file.  The new changes are described in messages posted to the Yahoo! LaserTank
 group - http://groups.yahoo.com/group/LaserTank/.

    Please record the levels as you play them, and send me the Playback (.LPB)
 files if you beat their current, Global High Scores (as indicated in the .GHS
 files).  Use the default filename (as suggested by the LaserTank program) for
 your playbacks.  Don't forget to enter your initials into the Author Field
 (4 characters max.), as I will use these playbacks to build the new GHS lists.
 The ONLY WAY TO PROVE YOUR PERFORMANCE IS TO SEND ME YOUR PLAYBACK FILES.

    Please rate the Unrated levels that you complete.  Feel free to suggest a
 new rating for any level that you think is inappropriately rated.

    Please report any errors and/or bad levels to me.  Also, if any levels are
 duplicated, or copies of someone elses levels, please report this to me.

    Use this new address : lasertank@cgocable.ca

 Thank You,
 Donald Drouin
