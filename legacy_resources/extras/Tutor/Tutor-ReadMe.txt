Tutor.LVL file is a collection of levels that shows tricks used
in some levels of the existing level sets. Some levels can't be
solved without using the tricks.

Some of the tricks are bugs that have been intentionally left in
the software because they make the game more interesting and
challenging.

In other kind of tricks, some objects interact in one move to
give unexpected outcome.

There are also levels to show LaserTank rules that can be
different with beginners' logical expectation.

All levels in this set are usually very short because the
authors have arranged the relevant objects to be ready for the
trick. The solution and the explanation of each level are given
by the author in the "Hint" box.

It is assumed that the players have played and solved various
LaserTank levels. The less experienced players are suggested to
play "Tutor-with-Playback.LVL", the longer tutorial levels that
can be replayed using their provided playback files. The new
players - that are not familiar with the game objects - are
suggested to play "Game-Objects-in-LT.LVL", the basic training
levels.

These tutorial levels were made/verified using LaserTank.exe
Ver 4.1. The use of earlier versions may cause different
results.

To play these tutorial levels, you must turn on the "Animation"
option; otherwise, the tank will temporarily disappear in
certain levels.
