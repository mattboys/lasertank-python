These tutorial levels were designed for complete beginners in
LaserTank. The levels were arranged in accordance with the
tutorial concept.

The players should have read "LaserTank Help". (In the game,
click on "Help" then click on "Index". It is necessary to know
the "Game Objects" and "Playback of a recorded LaserTank game".)

It is also suggested that the new players have tried/played
"Game-objects-in-LT.LVL", the sixteen levels that introduce the
LT game objects.

These tutorial levels were made using LaserTank.exe Ver 4.1. The
use of earlier versions may cause different results.

To play these tutorial levels, you must turn on the "Animation"
option; otherwise, the tank will temporarily disappear in
certain levels.


It's recommended to play in the following order:
  1) Try to solve each level by yourself before you read the
     hint.
  2) Read the hint after either you have solved the level or you
     have given up. If you have solved the level, try to
     optimize the solution. (Strive after the best score.)
  3) If necessary, use the corresponding playback file to see or
     compare the solution. It's interesting to see how other
     players make efficient moves.


The tutorial package contains:

* Tutor-with-Playbacks.LVL - This file contains all tutorial
  levels. The LaserTank.exe opens this file as the "Data File".
  (In the game, click on "Game" then click on "Open Data File".
  Or, press "O" on the keyboard.)

* Tutor-with-Playbacks_xxxx.lpb files are used by LaserTank.exe
  to replay the recorded solutions. (In the game, click on
  "Game" then click on "Playback Game". Or, press "F7" on the
  keyboard.)

* Tutor-with-Playbacks.ghs - It's the "Global High Score" file.
  The players who contribute the playbacks with the best score
  will have their initials in the list. The GHS will be updated
  when the new version is released.

* T-w-P-ReadMe.txt - This file.
